## TODO:

- stop using the cp2pluto script
- add wiring schematic photos and better info to the doc folder
- revise what data to monitor - eg nulls
- revise what parameters to use
- improve marker widths
- more to do in spClient to deal with doubling / fast changes /etc
- SOLVE network connections sometimes coming up in wrong order
    - hint: NetworkManager is a pain in the arse !

## Maybe one day

- move from Bookworm Desktop to Bookworm Lite or FreeBSD
